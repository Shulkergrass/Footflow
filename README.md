# Footflow
Inversity challenge #16 submission

This program is will display an example map which I have created using LibreOffice Draw, which can be toggled between the plain map and version of the map that represents footfall

On the right hand side, there is a section which will allow the user to leave a comment on an area of the map.
To do so, they must select one of the buttons on the map to decide which location to comment on.
They can then write their comment into a text box, select a category for their comment and tick a box if they want it to be public.
Once they have completed this, they can submit it, at which point the program will check that everything has been filled in correctly, before writing it to a file in an easy to read format.
After the comment has been saved and the user recieves confirmation of this, all of the ineteractive features will be reset to allow the user to easily enter another comment if they wish.

The purpose of this program is to act as a simulation for a map of the metaverse which would have user footfall data available on it, and allow users to comment on areas of the metaverse to allow them to share their own opinions, rather than relying purely on the objective data that has been gathered about them.
